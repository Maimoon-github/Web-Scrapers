At least two people were killed and more than a dozen others injured when a Mexican Navy training ship on a goodwill tour struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said.



There were 277 people on the sailing ship, called the Cuauhtémoc, at the time of the incident and everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said Saturday.



“At this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,” New York Mayor Eric Adamswrote on X.



The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship’s masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said. The ship has since been moved to Manhattan’s Pier 36, located along on East River less than a mile from the Brooklyn Bridge, the official added.



The ship appeared to lose power around 8:20 p.m. as the captain was maneuvering the ship, which forced the vessel towards the bridge’s pillar and the ship’s mast struck the bridge, New York Police Department Chief Wilson Aramboles said at a news conference Saturday.



The New York Fire Department saidin an emailto CNN it received the call that a ship had struck the bridge around 8:39 p.m.



Video shows the Cuauhtémoc’s mast hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passes through, with pieces falling down towards the deck. The bridge itself was not damaged and is reopened to traffic after briefly shutting down, Mayor Adams said on social media, citing a preliminary inspection.



The ship, adorned with white lights and flying a large Mexican flag, can be seen sailing closer to the edge of Brooklyn Bridge Park when its mast strikes the bottom of the bridge, snapping at parts and falling onto the deck below.



The training ship likely suffered a “mechanical issue” that forced the captain to lose power, police said in a news conference.



“The captain that was maneuvering the ship lost, I guess, power of the ship,” Chief Wilson Aramboles of the NYPD Special Operations Bureau told reporters Saturday evening.



Aramboles added that there were “some mechanical issues” that “probably” caused the ship to strike the bridge.



Officials warned that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation into what happened.



In its email to CNN, the fire department said more than 100 fire and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel responded to the scene.



The tall sailing ship caught the eyes of nearby pedestrians. Flavio Moreira was strolling with his family along the Brooklyn promenade when the ship struck the bridge. The area was bustling with people enjoying the warm evening, he said.



“But it just kept coming closer and closer to us, and at some point, I was like, ‘I don’t think that’s right,’” Moreira toldCNN’s Ben Hunt.



From the shore, Moreira said he could see people on the boat struggling after the collision.



“We could see some people being kind of dragged,” he said. “I believe it was some of the staff, they were on the top of the boat. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge.”



“The ship was just so close to us, so we could see all those people really struggling to just like holding onto something to… don’t fall from the boat,” he added.



Video of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridgeshows people hangingfrom at least one of its masts.



At least one person is seen clinging from a rope on the top-most rung of one mast, while several others on the top two rungs can be seen crawling to the center part of the mast. A few individuals can be seen climbing a ladder to reach those stuck.



On tall ships like the Cuauhtémoc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor.



There were sailors on the bridge’s mast who were injured, NYPD chief said.



The Mexican Navy previously said a total of 22 were hurt in a post in Spanish on X, with 19 receiving medical attention at local hospitals.



“The status of the personnel and material is under review by naval and local authorities, who are providing support,” the Mexican Navy said.



Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaumextended her condolencesto families of the two crew members killed.



“We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauhtémoc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,” Sheinbaum said on social media Sunday.



The Cuauhtémoc, a steel-hulled, three-masted barque about 300 feet long, is used to train cadets at Mexico’s Heroic Naval Military School, the country’s naval academy, according to anews release. Built in 1982, the ship has become a diplomatic emblem of Mexico’s maritime tradition.



Dubbed the “Ambassador and Knight of the Seas,” the ship was visiting New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was en route to Iceland at the time of the incident.



The Cuauhtémoc has since become a regular participant in prominent regattas worldwide. Before Saturday’s incident, it had been docked at the South Street Seaport since Tuesday.



All lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge were briefly closed in both directions after the incident but had reopened as of 10:30 p.m., according to New York emergency officials.



“While inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge at this time,” according to Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for Adams.

## 3. Russia-Ukraine talks

### Content:

Much has happened this week, but what failed to transpire is the more telling.



The firstdirect talks between Ukraine and Russiashould have heralded a new era of diplomacy towards solving Europe’s largest conflict since World War II. Instead, their context, brevity and limited outcome provided skeptics with more reasons to doubt Moscow wants peace.



The three conclusions – a prisoner swap,further talks about their presidents meeting, and both sides composing their vision of a future ceasefire – sound like progress.



Related live-storyUkraine’s allies call Russian demands unacceptable after first talks in years



But prisoner swaps occur regularly, Ukraine has already said it wants an immediate and unconditional ceasefire on air sea and land, and had already offered direct talks, between President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. Russia rejected those two ideas, but Friday said it would again consider them.



Diplomacy has travelled a long distance this week to essentially return to zero – back where it started on Saturday. Then, in Kyiv, Ukraine, France, Germany, the UK and Poland demanded an unconditional ceasefire for a month, and published a picture of the five countries’ leaders on the phone to President Trump. They trumpeted his backing for the truce, but also what France called “massive sanctions” if Russia rejected the demand.



Six days later, on Friday, they again posted a picture of the same five men, huddled again around a telephone, this time in the Albanian capital Tirana, talking to POTUS. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was “unacceptable” Russia continues to ignore a truce. The UK’s PM Keir Starmer said Putin “must pay the price for avoiding peace.”



The symmetry of the demands and the images was remarkable. In the past week, Trump has performed stunning diplo-gymnastics. Putin shrugged off the demands for a truce and suggested direct talks in Istanbul. Zelensky said he would meet Putin there, and Trump offered to be an intermediary. Putin rejected all bar a junior meeting. And then Trump deflated any sense of urgency by adding he never expected Putin to attend without his also being in Istanbul, apparently concluding that “nothing is gonna happen” on Ukraine before he meets the Kremlin head.



We do not know how European leaders handled the Friday call, a concerned Macron pictured at its center, but they surely had to remind Trump of promises made. Trump has shown reluctance to pressure or speak ill of Putin in public. Yet now his credibility with his closest European allies – “smart cookie” Macron, and “tough negotiator” Starmer, who offered him a second state visit – is on the line. It is unclear whether this will stir him.



We have now gone full circle, in just a week, through the contradictory emotions that beset the White House on this thorny foreign policy issue on which the US administration has over-promised to deliver.



Related articleA timeline of the Trump administration’s evolving approach to Russia-Ukraine peace talks



Two constants have emerged. Putin cares little for European or American pressure, simply proposing a minimalist peace offering, with maximalist demands, and refusing to budge. Trump seems to privately offers support to Ukraine and its allies, but publicly is seen extending the olive branch of a bilateral meeting with the Kremlin head, whenever Moscow is ready.



Intermittently, this White House has been keen to telegraph that their patience with Putin is limited, even expiring. Occasionally, even Trump hints at this, vaguely touting secondary sanctions as a throwaway remark earlier this week. Yet this impatience has yet to translate into the firm action Europe wants to see.



The White House benefits from the Kremlin’s deft baby-steps, insincere, inching towards peace. Russia does enough to permit Trump to pretend they are serious, while yielding no ground at all – even complicating matters Friday with a reported demand that Ukraine hand over territory Russia hasn’t conquered. There are enough vague, intractable whispers of diplomacy and further talks about talks, to provide the tantalising promise of a deal, without striking, or even delineating one. Russia is playing for time, evidently, and amassing forces on the eastern frontline, drone images show, ahead of a likely summer offensive.



Yet sometimes moments of clarity emerge. This week has perhaps helped elucidate where Moscow truly stands, but also too Trump’s reluctance to cause Putin pain. Clarity can be uncomfortable, and on Friday a stark assessment of Trump’s policy came from his former Ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, who resigned last month.



In an op-ed, Brink explained why:



“Unfortunately, the policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia…. As such, I could no longer in good faith carry out the administration’s policy and felt it was my duty to step down. ….Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement. And history has taught us time and again that appeasement does not lead to safety, security or prosperity. It leads to more war and suffering.”



It may be too early to determine whether Trump’s soft-gloves approach spells appeasement. But the US president has deflated a week of mounting tension and pressure on Moscow by suggesting no progress can be expected until he meets Putin.



And – as was the case with the elusive summit between Trump,Zelensky and Putin – do not expect this heady mix of egos, deference and loathing to yield results. Is the lesson of the past week that Trump will, in person, force Putin into accepting concessions that months of pressure, and years of brutal battlefield struggles, have not? Even an eventual summit between Trump and Putin may not fix the war, but instead reset the clock on diplomacy, and like this week leave Ukraine back at zero.

## 5. Romania’s presidential election re-run

**Link**: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/europe/romania-presidential-election-simion-dan-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/16/europe/romania-presidential-election-simion-dan-intl-cmd)

### Content:

A hard-right nationalist is favored to win Romania’s presidential election run-off on Sunday – a vote being held five months after theoriginal election was annulled.



George Simion won 41% of ballots cast in the first round of the re-run on May 4 – double the number of his rival, Nicusor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest.



Many see him as taking up the mantle of Calin Georgescu, the obscure ultranationalist who came from nowhere to win the first round and was poised to become Romania’s next president – until authorities said his TikTok-fueled campaign had been aided by Moscow, and called the vote off. Georgescu was laterbanned from May’s re-runafter being charged with various crimes, including founding a fascist group.



Simion and Georgescu showed up to a polling station together to cast their ballots on May 4, giving credence to the adage: “You can kill a man, but you can’t kill an idea.”



Simion’scommanding first-round leadmeant Sunday’s run-off had looked set to be a coronation. But, after trouncing Simion in a televised debate, Dan may have closed the gap. An opinion poll on Tuesday put the two candidates neck-and-neck, on 48% each.



The outcome could have profound consequences for Romania and the European Union, with Dan pledging to keep the Eastern European country on its pro-Western trajectory, while Simion wants to join a growing axis of hardline populists on Ukraine’s border.



Alongside Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Slovakia’s Robert Fico – self-styled “sovereigntists” who resent being told what to do by Brussels, despite their economies being heavily reliant on EU funds – Simion could further slow EU decisions on aid for Kyiv and sanctions against Moscow.



Last year’s canceled election has cast a huge shadow over the re-run, said Oana Popescu-Zamfir, director of the GlobalFocus Center, a  think tank in Bucharest.



“For the sovereigntist camp, it helped reinforce the narrative that the system is trying to rig elections. For the pro-democratic camp, it put the candidates on the defensive,” she told CNN.



Extraordinary decisions require extraordinary explanations, but Romanian authorities did little to justify their canceling of the election. Into this information vacuum poured conspiracies, anger – and US Vice President JD Vance. In his blistering speech at the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance singled out Romania as the grossest case of Europe’s “threat from within,” which he described as the “retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values” in terms of democracy and free speech.



The Trump administration’s intense focus on Romania helped make acause célèbreof Georgescu, who claimed he faced the same “lawfare” from the “deep state” as the US president. This provided fertile ground for Simion, who has continued to court the MAGA world.



“Hello to all of our MAGA friends,” Simion said Thursday on the “War Room” podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and long-time cheerleader of international populists. “If all goes well,” Simion said, he would put Georgescu “back in the leadership of Romania,” without saying how.



Since his first-round victory, Simion has spent a lot of time outside Romania, traveling to Austria, Italy, Poland, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.



His strategy is twofold, according to Corneliu Bjola, professor of digital diplomacy at the University of Oxford, and an expert in Romanian politics.



First, Simion wants to “establish a presidential profile,” and so has sought audiences with Orban, Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and other prominent figures on Europe’s hard-right, Bjola told CNN.



Second, he is attempting to mobilize the Romanian diaspora – one of the largest of any country in the world. Whereas mainstream parties have typically treated the millions of Romanians living abroad as an afterthought, Bjola said that Simion has made them a central part of his campaign. About 60% of the diaspora voted for Simion in the first round.



Unlike in neighboring Moldova – where the pro-EU President Maia Sandu secured a second-round win thanks to the votes of the more liberal Moldovan diaspora in November – Romanians living abroad have tended to vote for “anti-system candidates,” said Bjola. Many Romanians who left the country after it joined the EU in 2007 to seek better-paying jobs abroad resent that they had to do so, he explained.



Still, it’s “puzzling” given how antagonistic Simion is towards the EU, Bjola added. “If he managed to implement parts of his agenda, it would make life more difficult for the diaspora.”



Dan, Simion’s opponent, is also something of an anti-system candidate. A quiet mathematician with a long history as a civic activist, Dan has run as an independent, pledging to end corruption in Romania’s institutions. His simple pledge to restore “competency” to government is seen by many as radical.



While Simion has courted the diaspora, Dan has garnered huge backing in Romania’s cities, many of which have been filled with EU flags in recent nights in a show of support.



Despite trailing heavily in the first-round vote, Dan’s campaign has picked up momentum in recent days while his rival’s has stuttered. Simion has backtracked on his pledge to build one million apartments and sell them for just €35,000 ($39,000) each, admitting it was a marketing ploy to “break the information blockade” on his party, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians.



Simion’s campaign suffered again in what turned out to be the only debate between the two candidates last week. Simion has since avoided squaring off against Dan in other scheduled TV debates, leaving Dan to make his pitch on Romanian television while Simion focuses on social media.



“His team is trying to keep him away from the public eye as much as possible,” said Popescu-Zamfir. Simion prefers TikTok because it is “controlled communication, whereas in a debate, standing side-by-side, you get to see the contrast,” she said.



Investors have grown jittery at the prospect of a Simion victory. After the first-round vote, authorities had to cancel a bond auction, and its central bank sold off foreign exchange reserves to slow the slide of the Romanian leu against the euro.



Analysts have warned that victory for Simion this weekend could lead to a much more dramatic financial quake on Monday.



Bjola says the economy is not the only concern. He says there is a “fear” in Bucharest that he hasn’t sensed in decades, since the fall of the bloody communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu.



After Georgescu was banned from running, Simion said the authorities who took the decision “should be skinned alive in the public square.” Georgescu’s supporters clashed with police in the capital that night.



Simion has already begun to lay the ground for potential disorder if he does not win on Sunday, observers say.



“We are winning by a landslide,” he told Jack Posobiec, an American far-right conspiracy theorist and podcast host. “The only thing that can stop us is some people interfering with the voting process,” he said.
