## Scraped Information

For each app, the scraper attempts to extract:

- App title and ID
- Developer name and URL
- Rating and number of ratings
- Price and free/paid status
- Category and content rating
- App description
- Screenshots and icon URLs
- Installation size
- Current version
- Required Android version
- In-app purchase information

## Analysis Features

The app analysis provides valuable insights:

- **Category Distribution**: Which app categories are most common

## Best Practices Implemented

This scraper follows ethical scraping practices:

1. **Mimics human behavior** with random delays between requests
2. **Uses rotating user agents** to appear as different browsers
3. **Respects robots.txt** rules when configured to do so
4. **Handles errors gracefully** with intelligent retry logic
5. **Limits request volume** to avoid overwhelming the server

## Limitations

- Google Play Store structure may change, requiring selector updates
- Some app information may be hidden or dynamically loaded
- The script doesn't collect user reviews (could be added as an extension)
- Very large apps with many screenshots may have incomplete data
